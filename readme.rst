JournalCon 2003
===============

JournalCon 2003 was a small, nation-wide convention for online journal writers held in Austin, Texas in Oct. 2003.

History
-------

The original JournalCon 2003 web site (http://webwritersweekend.com/) was powered by a custom-built content management system. That system was refactored to use the CodeIgniter framework and Smarty template engine in 2008.

The repository is an archive for that site.
